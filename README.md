# Ease MD

A lightweight, Typora-style Markdown editor for Windows and macOS, built with Tauri.

## Getting started

This repository provides a minimal Tauri shell with a Vite + CodeMirror 6 frontend for editing and previewing Markdown.

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable)
- Node.js (for frontend tooling)
- Tauri CLI (`cargo install tauri-cli`)

### Run the app

```bash
npm install
cargo tauri dev
```

The Tauri dev command will launch the Vite dev server automatically.

## Roadmap
